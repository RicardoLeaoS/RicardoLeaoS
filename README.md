- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Ricardo ! I am a Data Scientist with an important background on Combinatorial Optimization as Degree and Masters in France and Brazil. 
I am currently empolyed in the biggest bank in South America as a Data Scientist focusing on investments products.

My github repos are mainly used for the courses I usually take in a couple of different resources. It is useful for (obviously) versioning my code and also to have a place to quick access some functions already coded.

There are also some private repositories that I use to play around with side projects.

I am focusing my studies now in Machine and Deep Learning to complement my Optimization skills.

- ðŸ“« You can reach out to me on my e-mail ricardo.leao.soares@gmail.com or on my linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/r-leao. (it's been a while since I have updated my english/french versions)
